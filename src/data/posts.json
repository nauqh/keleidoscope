It lives in the gap where human intimacy is invited, where closeness is asked to arrive, yet something never quite reaches completion. The invitation to close the distance remains unfinished, no matter how near two bodies become.",

            "description": "Father Issues is an apple pie story about devotion, denial, and the slow violence of what cannot be said. A family of three builds a childhood out of sweetness and ritual, until the sweetness rots day by day and absence takes shape through gradual removal. Told in a slow-cinema rhythm, the story leans on imagery and action over dialogue, letting quiet trauma lay itself out, sometimes even through humour.",
